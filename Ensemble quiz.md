1. Which of the following best describes the main idea of ensemble methods?

A) Train one strong model to make predictions
B) Combine multiple weak or strong models to improve performance
C) Use only decision trees for predictions
D) Reduce the size of the dataset to speed up training

Answer: B
Explanation: Ensemble methods combine multiple models to reduce variance, bias, or improve predictions. This is the core idea behind methods like Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking.

2. Bagging is primarily used to:

A) Reduce bias
B) Reduce variance
C) Increase dataset size
D) Reduce feature dimensions

Answer: B
Explanation: Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) trains multiple models on random samples of the data and averages their predictions, which reduces variance and prevents overfitting.
